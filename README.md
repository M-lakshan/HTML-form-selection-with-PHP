# HTML-form-selection-with-PHP
I've created a form selection area that retrieves data from DB through a while loop.  In a previous time I set this selection>options to be selected according to the retrieved data but when I used the regular method on this while-loop-selection it does not give me an output(unless I interact with the element), or an error. I want to make this to output the data as a regular selection that connected to a DB.
In regular selection there was only div>select>options & the options were hardcoded but the differences I made were adding a 'datalist' in between div and select & retrive the data through a while-loop.
